# ClaudeBox Configuration File
# Place this file as .claudebox.yml in your project root

# Custom volume mounts
# These mounts will be added to the container in addition to the default mounts
# CLI mounts (--mount flag) will override config file mounts for the same container path
mounts:
  # Mount a data directory with read-write access
  - host: ~/data
    container: /data
    readonly: false

  # Mount a models directory as read-only
  - host: ~/models
    container: /models
    readonly: true

  # Mount a cache directory
  - host: ~/.cache/myapp
    container: /cache
    readonly: false

# Notes:
# - host: Path on your local machine (~ expands to $HOME)
# - container: Path inside the container
# - readonly: true for read-only (ro), false for read-write (rw)
# - Host paths that don't exist will be skipped with a warning
