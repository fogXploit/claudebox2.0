# ShellCheck configuration for ClaudeBox
# Bash 3.2 compatibility required for macOS/Linux portability

# Specify shell directive
shell=bash

# Disable specific warnings that are intentional design choices

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# We dynamically source library files
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# ShellCheck can't always find our sourced files
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Many variables are used indirectly or in sourced files
disable=SC2034

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# We use this pattern intentionally for readability in many places
disable=SC2155

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# Sometimes we intentionally want word splitting
# But generally we should quote - only disable where needed

# SC2181: Check exit code directly instead of $?
# Sometimes checking $? is clearer for complex commands
disable=SC2181

# SC2059: Don't use variables in the printf format string
# We use color variables in printf format strings intentionally and safely
disable=SC2059
